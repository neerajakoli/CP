# Bisection Algorithm comes into play!
# We know that the square root of x lies between 1 and x, from mathematics
# Rather than exhaustively trying things starting at 1, suppose instead we pick a number in the middle of this range
# Bisection search works when value of function varies monotonically with input
# If g, the users input/guess, is less than/greater than the midpoint of the range, then that number becomes the new high point of said range and is then factored into the new search.
